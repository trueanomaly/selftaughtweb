# Self Taught Web and Mobile Development
## Example code from the book

The code is organized into folders for each chapter. 

## Chapter 2 Code
The code in this folder is for two examples. The first example uses index.html and style.css to show how the two files link to one another and how CSS code can be used to target HTML tags and apply styles to them. Download the code using the link in the upper right corner of the repository and open index.html in a web browser to view it (double clicking .html files should open a web browser by default). If you want to view the source code, drag the file to a text editor such as Notepad, TextEdit, or SublimeText, or use the online editor within Github by clicking on the file, and then clicking the pencil icon.

The second example uses index2.html and app.js. It shows how to connect Javascript code to an HTML file. Open index2.html in a browser and try out the multiplier.
